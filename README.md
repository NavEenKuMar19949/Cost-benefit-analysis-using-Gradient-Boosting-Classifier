Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is a popular and powerful ensemble learning algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning. It is a type of boosting method that trains multiple weak learners sequentially, with each subsequent model learning from the errors of its predecessors, resulting in a stronger learner.
